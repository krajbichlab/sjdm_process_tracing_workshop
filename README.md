# Windows into the choice process: A workshop on online eye-tracking, mouse-tracking, and text analysis with LLMs
> Judgment and decision-making research often focuses on the process by which people make decisions, and process models require process data. In the past, collecting process data has been costly and challenging. However, times are changing. This workshop introduces three affordable ways to quickly and easily collect (and analyze) process data online: webcam-based eye-tracking, mouse-tracking, and large language models (LLMs) for analyzing think-aloud protocols.
> Each topic was presented by a speaker during the workshop, who introduced the tool and provided a hands-on tutorial with example code. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the speakers via email!
