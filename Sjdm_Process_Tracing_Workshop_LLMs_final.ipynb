Well, if for some reason those were too much of a mouthful, we now have Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bits. Yes, these are about half the size of the Bite Size versions. This particular one is \"Cinnamon Roll\".<br /><br />There is nothing new to the table here with the exception of size, which I is unnecessary. Personally, I like original flavor and size the best. But the Bite Size edition were accommodating. These come off as a desperate attempt to give attention to a brand that needs some sort of life put back into it and all they came up with was making them smaller and having a new flavor, which is actually too sweet for me.<br /><br />A serving size is approximately 47 biscuits. Thats 1 gram of polyunsaturated fat, 46 grams of carbohydrates, 6g fiber, 12g of sugar, 5g of protein and 200mg of potassium. Generally they look good but I guess those that are watching their carb intake might want to be careful.<br /><br />These probably fit on a spoon better than its predecessors in a bowl of milk, but I like the other kinds cause they snack better without the milk. But here, these small ones are easily to snack more than you should.<br /><br />I am grading this product 2 stars for 3 reasons 1) I dont think making them smaller has any reason for existing outside of Kellogs filling the shelves with more versions of something that was fine to begin with. 2) This flavor, Cinnamon Roll, is sweet and has a synthetic taste to it. 3) On the plus side, I like Mini-Wheats in general, so it saved it from being one

So I was determined not to overcook these brown rice noodles. I tried making two dishes. The first was a miso soup with brown rice noodles, which was really just broth with miso and green onions and the noodles added when it was hot. The noodles softened and puffed up, but I think I should of softened them in water and maybe rinsed them first. The broth ended up being a little starchy from the noodles, but it was pretty good.<br /><br />The noodles by themselves don't really have any flavor, they just take on the flavor of whatever dish they are in. So the rice noodles in miso probably wasn't the best idea because the mild miso flavor didn't really give the noodles much flavor. I also tried stir frying the noodles which was much better. I just soaked the noodles in hot water, for about a minute, and then drained them. They came out clear and kind of crunchy. Then I stir fried them with garlic, onion, salt, and coconut oil. I also added some vinegar and nama shoyu for flavor. These noodles came out crunchy and spicy and actually were pretty good.<br /><br />The nice thing about these noodles is they only need about a minute in warm water and then they can be fried or added to soups or other dishes, so they are fairly versatile. They are also gluten free and the brown rice noodles seem more firm than the white rice noodles. As another reviewer posted it does look like these noodles are made in Singapore.\",\n          \"My cat loves these treats. If ever I can't find her in the house, I just pop the top and she bolts out of wherever she was hiding to come get a treat. She doesn't like crunchy treats much, so these are perfect for her. I've given her all three flavors and she seems to like them all equally. They do tend to dry out by the time I near the end of the bottle, however. The flip-top lid is very handy. Very nice, inexpensive kitty treats.
